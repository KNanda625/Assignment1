          I am born and raised in Colorado and graduated with my Bachelor's of Science in Psychology from CU Denver.  I completed the pre-med program and worked in medical research at Anschutz.  My work was focused on the chickenpox virus and its relation to stroke.  I currently work in Early Intervention with kids who have developmental delays and/or disabilities.  I manage a caseload of 40-50 kiddos and work with their families to find them in-home therapists.

          I love dogs and am a huge supporter of rescues and adoption.  I have three dogs and am hoping to adopt more.  I like to spend my free time traveling, going to concerts, attending comic-con annually, crafting, and binging my favorite TV shows.

          I am very new to the coding world, but I am excited to continue expanding my knowledge in this area.
